# Fitting-and-Alignment
This assignment provided comprehensive practical experience in key computer vision techniques.
Through blob detection using Laplacian of Gaussian, I gained understanding of scale-space analysis and local extrema detection for feature extraction. The RANSAC implementation for line and circle fitting demonstrated robust model estimation in noisy environments. The homography and warping exercises provided hands-on experience with projective geometry for planar surface alignment, while the image stitching task integrated SIFT feature matching with homography estimation for automated panorama creation. The assignment successfully bridged theoretical concepts with practical implementation, emphasizing parameter selection, optimization constraints, and error metrics in real-world computer vision applications.
